### Using GitHub

It is beyond the scope of this readme to teach the proper use of Git and GitHub, but you can always reach out personally for help. Some steps to get you started though (google steps if unsure):
 - `make github account`
 - `fork the repository`
 - `make changes, commit changes, push changes`
 - `create pull requests`

### Commits and Pulls

Please provide proper commit messages when contributing, this will make it much easier to approve pull requests. Don't change anything in the config unless you really need to.
